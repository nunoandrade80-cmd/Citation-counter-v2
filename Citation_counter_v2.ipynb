        "## PMID Citation Count Generator\n",
        "\n",
        "This script is designed to automate the process of fetching citation counts for a list of PubMed IDs (PMIDs) using the Europe PMC API and generating an organized Excel report.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Flexible PMID Input**: You can provide PMIDs in two ways:\n",
        "    *   **Manual String**: Paste a comma-separated string of PMIDs directly into the `pmid_string_manual` variable within the script.\n",
        "    *   **File Upload**: If the manual string is left empty, the script will prompt you to upload a plain text file (`.txt`) containing PMIDs. This file can have PMIDs separated by commas on a single line, or one PMID per line.\n",
        "2.  **Europe PMC API Integration**: The script queries the Europe PMC API to retrieve the `citedByCount` for each PMID. It includes error handling for API request failures and JSON parsing issues, and a small delay between requests to prevent rate limiting.\n",
        "3.  **Excel Report Generation**: All collected data (PMID and its citation count) is compiled into a pandas DataFrame, which is then saved as an Excel file (`citations.xlsx`).\n",
        "4.  **Automatic Download**: The generated Excel file is automatically downloaded to your local machine upon completion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Use:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Configure Input**: Decide whether to use manual input or file upload.\n",
        "    *   **For Manual Input**: Locate the `pmid_string_manual` variable in the code cell below and replace the empty string with your comma-separated PMIDs (e.g., `pmid_string_manual = \"12345678,98765432\"`).\n",
        "    *   **For File Upload**: Ensure `pmid_string_manual` is an empty string (`\"\"`). When you run the code cell, a file upload dialog will appear. Select your `.txt` file containing PMIDs.\n",
        "2.  **Run the Code**: Execute the code cell provided below.\n",
        "3.  **Monitor Progress**: The script will print updates as it fetches citation counts for each PMID. For large lists, it will show progress every 50 PMIDs.\n",
        "4.  **Receive Output**: Once all data is fetched and the Excel file is generated, it will be automatically downloaded to your browser's default download location. A confirmation message will also be printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This script is self-contained and ready for immediate use. For future reference, you can save this notebook to your Google Drive or GitHub.\n"
